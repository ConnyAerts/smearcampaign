README for chemical abundances for B. Pope TRES spectra of smear targets
Total Unique targets with seismic log g info (and spectra): 35

Stellar parameters are fixed in the following way:
Teff -- fixed from spc_giants.csv file
log g -- fixed to the seismic values (log_g_s) in pope_asteroseismology.csv

Both of these files have been merged (and removed of duplicates in final_pope_merged.fits).

vmic, and broadening (convolution by Vmac, vsini and instrument) as well as [Fe/H] and all chemical abundances are derived using BACCHUS ( ascl:1605.004)

The files come in currently two versions:
*_nodiff -- This implies no line-by-line differential anlysis (discussed in Jofre et al. 2015 and implmented in Hawkins et al. 2016: APOGEE) has been done
*_diff_arcturus -- This implies that all abundances were derived using a line-by-line differential approach with respect to Arcturus.

NOTE: where there are empty plots it indicates that either there were no stars where the abundances could be reliably computed or for the *_diff_arcturus case the solar-scaled [X/H] value for arcturus was unknown.
The abundances for Arcturus are taken from Hawkins et al. 2016 and the stellar parameters are fixed to the values in (final_pope_benchmarks.fits; also displayed in Jofre et al. 2015)

Finally -- this is a first pass, while it is unexpected that the abundances should change largely they may change specifically the zero-points depending on how BACCHUS is able to deal with the spectra from this instrument. The benchmark stars allow us to evaulate that.
